excerpt: 'The development of connected vehicle (CV) systems relies on accurately identifying preceding vehicles, a critical step for effective vehicle-to-vehicle communication. However, GPS devices, essential for this process, are prone to positional errors, which can lead to misidentification and, in severe cases, cause drivers to follow the wrong vehicle, increasing the risk of accidents. Our research focused on addressing this issue by building and testing a real-time preceding vehicle identification system (PVIS) prototype. The system used an iterative matching strategy to mitigate GPS errors, aimed at advancing the commercial viability of CV technology.'

I played a central role in this project, researching algorithms for preceding vehicle identification and conducting field evaluations in a CV environment. One of my key contributions was implementing the iterative matching algorithm that uses probabilistic modeling to reduce sensor errors, significantly enhancing system accuracy. Additionally, I integrated GPS and time-of-flight (TOF) sensors on the Jetson Nano platform, prototyping a system that enabled real-time data transfer between vehicles via TCP sockets during field tests.
This project not only allowed me to contribute technically but also to demonstrate leadership in problem-solving and system design, driving improvements that are critical for the future commercial deployment of CV systems.
