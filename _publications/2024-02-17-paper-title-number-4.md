excerpt: 'In our research, we addressed the critical challenge of device fingerprinting and user action inference through IoT traffic. Our work focused on answering four key questions: the granularity of device and user fingerprinting, the accuracy of fingerprinting methods, scalability across datasets, and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques. We evaluated state-of-the-art fingerprinting technologies, categorizing them based on different approaches used, while re-implementing and testing them across various datasets. A core insight from our research was the identification of areas where current defense strategies are inadequate. We revealed new dimensions in which these defenses require further consideration and demonstrated the potential inconsistency of existing strategies using open-source datasets.'

My contributions included implementing and executing experiments to analyze IoT device inference attacks and testing mitigation techniques. I explored and evaluated the effectiveness of five device identification algorithms, highlighting performance degradation over time, which offers insights for future improvements. Additionally, I reproduced eight deep learning and data morphing models from prior research and evaluated their effectiveness on a public dataset. This hands-on approach not only provided a deeper understanding of the limitations of current methods but also informed potential future directions for IoT security research.
