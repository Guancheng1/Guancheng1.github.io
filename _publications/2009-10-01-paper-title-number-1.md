excerpt: 'In this research, we investigated the prevalence and characteristics of mutual TLS connections, including the associated services and patterns of certificate usage. Specifically, by analyzing TLS connection logs collected from a large campus network over 23 months, we identified over 2.2 million unique server certificates and over 3.4 million unique client certificates used in over 1.2 billion mutual TLS connections. Using this data, we examined security concerns, non-standard behaviors in certificate sharing, and the privacy implications of sensitive information found in mutual TLS certificates.'
