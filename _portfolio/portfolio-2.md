title: "Enhancing HRI Communication: Proactive Accent Recognition and Language Switching Robot"
excerpt: "The central problem regarding verbal communication in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is an often lack of verbal understanding between the human and robot involved in the interaction, and this phenomena can further manifest itself if a non-native English speaker is attempting to interact with an English-speaking robot. Developing a solution towards this problem is important from the perspective of enhanced interactions between humans and robots and overall ease-of-use. 
The central research question for this project is “Does a robot that actively recognizes the native language of a human interacter based on their accent and prompts the need to communicate in that language (Proactive robot), imprint a better impression on the human interacter than a robot that switches language only when prompted (Reactive robot)?” The two hypotheses developed alongside the research question are “a robot that actively changes language based on detected accent leaves the human interacter with a better impression than a robot that changes language only when prompted” and “A robot that fails to correctly recognize the native language of a human interacter does not yield a worse impression than a robot that changes language only when prompted”.  <br/><img src='/images/Nao.png' width='500'>"
