title: "Deepfake Detection"
excerpt: "Fake media poses an ever-increasing threat to society. Deepfake technology represents the state of the art in
generating fake media. Deepfakes are artificial images, video, and audio which can
be nearly impossible for humans to differentiate from real media. This presents threats to our technological
lifestyles and media-dominated culture through the possibility of malicious intervention and cybersecurity
risks. We propose to detect fake media by creating and maintaining a list of “valid” media. As original works
of media are created and uploaded to a platform (regardless of where), we will also add a hashed copy of
this media to a global list. Obviously, with this approach it is impossible to capture all valid media that
exists or has existed - in this detection method, we restrict our scope to news media, since this is comparatively simple to manage and is an area where fake media is
particularly damaging. Further development is needed here to turn this into a viable solution for all media,
as simply backing up all media is a brute force solution. Here, news media serves as a motivating example
that is both important and approachable.<br/><img src='/images/deepfake.jpeg'> <br/> <a href='https://github.com/ahmedh409/deepfake-detection'> [Code Base] </a> <a href='/files/Deepfake_Summary.pdf'> [Project Overview] </a> <hr>"

Current deepfake detection techniques rely almost exclusively machine learning techniques, where private corporations or research institutions construct models with huge
amounts of data. Using pure ML approaches is inadvisable for a few reasons: a) these models are trained on
data which covers attacks discovered before the date of model creation; b) these models need to be recreated
from scratch each time; c) they are generally not openly-available for the public to use due to sunk costs;
d) when new detection models are published, deepfake generation techniques gain a new adversary to train
against, and the task of detecting them gets more difficult. we present our ideas for a detection framework of "perceptographic” hashing. Rather than approaching the cat-and-mouse game of training models, finding
new attacks, and training better models, we take the assumption that deepfakes will someday be truly indistinguishable from reality and that a different, more fundamental approach is necessary.

An example:
-
Imagine several prominent news publishers (e.g. CNN, New York Times, etc.) decided to work together
to prevent the proliferation of altered versions of their original content. The publishers would maintain a
collective list of media that they have published; each time one of them publishes a new artifact, they will automatically add the hash of the artifact (“perceptographic” hash) to the
global list (blockchain). If a random person on the internet wants to check the validity of a news artifact,
they could do so through some interface (e.g. web extension, website, etc.) by checking if the hash of the
artifact is in the list of accepted hashes. <br/> <a href='https://github.com/ahmedh409/deepfake-detection'> [Code Base] </a> <a href='/files/Deepfake_Summary.pdf'> [Project Overview] </a>
