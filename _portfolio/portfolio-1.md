title: "Deepfake Detection"
excerpt: "Fake media poses an ever-increasing threat to society. Deepfake technology represents the state of the art in
generating fake media, such as images and videos. Deepfakes are artificial images, video, and audio which can
be nearly impossible for humans to differentiate from real media. This presents threats to our technological
lifestyles and media-dominated culture through the possibility of malicious intervention and cybersecurity
risks. We propose to detect fake media by creating and maintaining a list of “valid” media. As original works
of media are created and uploaded to a platform (regardless of where), we will also add a hashed copy of
this media to a global list. Obviously, with this approach it is impossible to capture all valid media that
exists or has existed - in this detection method, we restrict our scope to news media such as television news
and online publications, since this is comparatively simple to manage and is an area where fake media is
particularly damaging. Ideally, we will expand the scope of the detection mechanism as the tools we develop
for detection improve. Further development is needed here to turn this into a viable solution for all media,
as simply backing up all media is a brute force solution. Here, news media serves as a motivating example
that is both important and approachable.<br/><img src='/images/deepfake.jpeg'> <br/> <a href=“https://github.com/ahmedh409/deepfake-detection”> [Code Base] </a> a href=“/files/Deepfake_Summary.pdf
