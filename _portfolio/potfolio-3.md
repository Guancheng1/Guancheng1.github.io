title: "Second-Hand Market Platform"
excerpt: "Many university students want to sell or buy second-hand furniture, but there's often a timing mismatch: sellers are usually graduating seniors, while buyers are incoming students who donâ€™t arrive until August. Additionally, students prefer to protect their personal information and avoid direct transactions with strangers. To address these issues, we proposed developing a university-specific second-hand marketplace website, facilitating coordination between buyers and sellers and enhancing transaction safety.<br/> <b>A video example of features of the website<b/>ðŸ‘‡<br/>"

We are actively developing new features for this website including potential collaboration with UVA Storage Scholars
to further enhance the community of second hand trading. Hopefully in the near future we can deploy this website and assists citizens in charlottesville especially for minority groups like international students.
